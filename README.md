# fuzzy-find
Find anything on a web page in chrome with fuzzy search.

This chrome extension enhances your `ctrl+f` experience in the browser by not being so strict and serious about searching through text. Instead of getting only exact matches to your search query, you're shown all the various possible results you could be asking for, using fuzzy search.

This makes searching through web articles, documentation, APIs etc so much better!

## Requirements
- Node.js and npm
- Google Chrome
- [parcel-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-bundler)
